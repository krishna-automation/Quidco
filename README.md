# Quidco
Quidco - Technical task

This is a Maven - Cucumber JVM project.
Appium not used here  - No configuration / setup done in Appium ( Just used Eclipse IDE and framework designed to cover the Page Object pattern of Join Us and Sign In scenarios ). 
Only dummy locators are used ( dummy By.name or By.xpath ) as no inspection of elements is done. It's like a prototype. Proper run is not expected.
Sign In with facebook not covered here.
Data parameterized for different users / email addresses
